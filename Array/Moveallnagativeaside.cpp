//Program to Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with constant extra space

//One More Method:--->
//Two Pointer Approach: The idea is to solve this problem with constant space and linear time is by using a two-pointer or two-variable approach where we simply take two variables like left and right which hold the 0 and N-1 indexes. Just need to check that :
//Above Method Algorithm
//Check If the left and right pointer elements are negative then simply increment the left pointer.
//Otherwise, if the left element is positive and the right element is negative then simply swap the elements, and Simultaneously increment or decrement the left and right pointers.
//Else if the left element is positive and the right element is also positive then simply decrement the right pointer.
//Repeat the above 3 steps until the left pointer â‰¤ right pointer.
